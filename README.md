# Protien-Synthesis

The goal of this code is to write a program that mimics the process of protein synthesis in animal cells. The first half focuses on the process of transcription and translation. Then the concept of mutation.

Each gene codes for a protein, and transcription is the first step of gene expression. MRNA, like DNA, is made of the same nucleobases, except for one: it does not contain thymine represented by [T], but instead contains uracil [U]. That means that the complement of [A] in mRNA is [U]. As such, the rules of matching in mRNA are as follows:

[A] ---> [U]
[T] ----> [A]
[C] ------> [G]
[G] -------> [C]
