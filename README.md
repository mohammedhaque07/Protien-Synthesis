# Protien-Synthesis

The aim of this code is to create a program that simulates the process of protein synthesis in animal cells. The first half focuses on the process of transcription and translation. Then the concept of mutation.

Each gene codes for a protein, and transcription is the first step of gene expression. MRNA, like DNA, is made of the same nucleobases, except for one: it does not contain thymine , but instead contains uracil . That means that the complement of [A] in mRNA is [U]. The rules are:

Thymine represented by [T]
Uracil represented by [U]
Adenine represented by [A]
Guanine represented by [G]
Cytocine represented by [C]

[A] ---> [U]
[T] ----> [A]
[C] ------> [G]
[G] -------> [C]
